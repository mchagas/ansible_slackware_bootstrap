You will most certainly want to put newer copies of sbopkg, sbotools and slackpkg+ in this directory, then edit the filenames in slackware-admin-setup.yaml to match.

sbopkg is here:     https://www.sbopkg.org/
sbotools is here:   https://pink-mist.github.io/sbotools/
slackpkg+ is here:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/slackpkgplus/files/

Happy hunting!
